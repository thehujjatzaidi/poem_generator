The time has come
What I think now, is the time has come
To tell you how I feel, when there's no sun
It's true that you care a lot about me,
But one day you'll be someone's bride which I cannot see.
My expectations from you are totally different,
I am telling you, my feelings are not here on rent,
You were my kid crush, when I saw you first,
How much we joked, then laughed, and then burst
What turned into friendship over all these years,
I for you, & you for me, always ears,
I believe Allah has the power to give us this life,
But maybe for now, we should break our ties.
You are a part of my strength with which I wake up
No day goes by when I don't text you, "What's up?"
You're no more a want, a habit, but you are a need
I have the baddest of life, you know all my deeds.
Best friends are not allowed to fall for one other,
Sadly if one falls, situation is like a feather.
I wish you could find a new best friend,
I am telling you again, my feelings are not a trend.
You'll see in four years, when I'll be on that side,
Waving to you, coming to you on that tide, 
Only praying to Allah, I shouldn't be late,
That will be the day, I'll check my own fate.
You love me as a brother, and that I respect,
But I am only lying to you in every aspect,
Maybe, what we need now is not a break,
Perhaps you'll be happy, only if we will separate
Praying in myself, that you'll say 'don't worry',
"You are a part of life, and I am your cherry."
"For now lets move on with what we feel,
and not say a thing, writing this day, in our life's reel"

I don’t have words to say
I want to but i don't have words to say
Don't you think we both are our life's prey
We are getting mature and knowing each other
Alhamdulillah, atleast you are present for me forever 
I know I've said things i shouldn't have
But you should know, after saying all of that I was also sad
All what now i know is, that we should flow with time
Then mumma's will decide with whom we will rhyme 
I don't have expectations from you anymore (in certain ways)
Allah will answer my prayers, and for that I'm sure

Best Friend
Amber is she who I will be talking about,
I just have one photo of her, with a baby pout
She is the best person for me, and she really really cares
Hijab is a part of her beauty, which is not just hiding hairs
Except me, will soon expect her to be married, be a good wife
Perhaps I'm not that lot, i wish she should live a happy life
She has changed me as a person recently in all these years
Now it's only she, who i dont know why i regularly fear
Amburr and i have shared something around like 10 years
And whenever i needed her, she was always my brain and i had her ears
She usually says this to me, that I'm (me) not a normal peer
But if anyone else tries to say this to me, if saw her face then fears
Although I started to write this being her best friend,
And now maybe I'm taking it to some very other end
But all what I've said, is just so very true
If she is Cinderella, no one can ever touch her shoe

A thought
A thought just happened, to cross my idiotic mind
That maybe to tell you, this is not the proper time
I'll only and only tell you, all the things line by line
But when, the time, you and me all of them will be mine
Once again I should say this, maybe not this time
Just in the coming three four years, you'll know my story line

My positivity
Sometimes i just don't know why I'm so positive
In the dark night, I'm like a glowing light
I'm the light that disturbs all the bugs
But when someone disturbs the wire,
You can see myself in rags and rugs
They absorb my light, those theif and thugs
And then leave me alone when my life sucks
I'm present like a man in a white shine armor
No they don't do to me any physical torcher
But, they behave like I'm their friend, only formal
I'm tired of my goodness, but what should i do
Maybe right now I'm crying, 
but when they'll need me, happiness will be thru
I just get happy, even if they need little help,
It's like, i can't stay in if they're banging hard bells

The day I saw you
A glimpse of you I got on the road,
It was cars, trees, you, me and some board
Dusk it was, was happening night,
I could have been a pilot, with you in my flight
I was on my pending walk of the dawn,
Wish i could stare at you, on and on and ON
Ants, bugs, trees, shrubs, humans and birds,
All they could see, boy and a girl, crossing each other,
Could have been some pigeon even present there ?
It would have noticed my heartbeat and stared
You flushed me with feelings all over again,
But such a beauty, such a creation, i lost my hopes again
I wish the time would come that i could,
Tell you, all about you, that's hidden inside my hood

Praising my love
Neither I'm a poet, nor I'm a writer
But the more I come closer to you, 
I'm sure that you're a fighter
The push that I need every time to work hard,
It's your words in that poem which make me feel I'm smart
and so I work hard
Life has not been good with you,
But you're that lighthouse to me,
In the dark sea and that's very true
You're like that kid, who breaks the window of my mansion
But what to say, it's been only you
It can be 'only *you*', who breaks off my tension
In my Harry Potter, I've got many Hermione and many Rons
and it's true I've got many snakes, 
But what to worry about, when I have you as my Severus Snapes
Trust me, girl you're that cherry to my life's cake
I swear on my life, it's my duty, I'll always keep you safe 
I don't know whether I'll ever be able to handle what you do
But what I fear the most, only if you'll hold my hand, I'll go thru it too
People count me to be in a family of five,
Only if I could say to them that I count you in too,
It's you four I call the superwomen file
Can you even imagine how important are you to me in my life?
All is fine but tbt I wanted to meet a superman,
But what is his need now, I have got my own super lady and I'm her big fan

Life
This life just happened, and we know it hit us hard
Didn't even gave you the proper time to start
The second word for life is problem(s) anyway
Success is overcoming those problems and then find the way
Maybe now it seems like, all the dots are scattered like stars
But they all will bow before and then align when you'll be ready to start
Life in all depends on how you frame the things and see
It's just, you've to look the right path, opportunities are like a sea
There's nothing impossible, if you are able to imagine it
It's just hard work daily, and then a void will need you to fill it
Big men are at big spots not because of intelligence
Success is not biased, neither for ladies nor for gents
I know one day you'll rise like a shining star, where no body expected the light
And that one day, I will be proud, when you'll tell us about your fight

Lily and the bee
You are the flower, and I am 'a' bee...
No you're not lotus, but you are Lilly 
(Lotus grows in dirt, but you are the cleanest I've seen)
This bee may be irritating, but one day you'll see,
You'll be responsible for what this bee will one day be....
The first thing it learned which lilly made him do
Was to turn emotions in words, and then save her in them too..
This is not a talent of his, but a shadow of her among the two
But he just writes to save her with his moments all thru...
Lilly is a flower, so beautiful and yellow
This bee has always been to her a dirty fellow
The bee has to out stand several others of his clan
But bee just always needs Lilly as he is her big fan
If lilly would one day change her colors to white
The bee would simply blame others and start a fight
But lilly has all the rights to change her colours
But she needs to be, where they met so that bee could direct his flight ....
Lilly and the bee have been friends for years
The irritating humming became constant to her ears
But she still never complained as they both were friends too close
And losing her has always been , bee's biggest fear

Fight
I don't know what you might say when you will read
I don't know what I'm thinking when I'm writing
I don't know what is going on with me
And I just don't know who can I complain
Because there's no ear, no eye or maybe now I'm just shy
I know I've to cross the ocean one day
But which direction to go is something I cannot say
You were the one person I trusted like a blind
You were the one person I believed like a child
You were the one soul I ever tried to love and care
You were the one soul who just didn't do it fair
It's like eight tunnels in front of me and choose one of them
But it was just you just you just you who was my only stem
I just run away from every problem like it would never come back
But every single night, every single dream it hits me on my back
Maybe it's the courage now what I think I just lack
It's time for me to bring some distance and put my heart on the rack
I cry every other night and the reason is not you
It's just that now there's no phuddu to listen me to
Obviously it's true that Allah will fill the pain with time
But there will always be a dream that would come to me at night
A dream....
that I will always have to fight,
and always have to fight

Putting feelings in a cage
Really words are the best way to take myself out
Really it is just the only way to cry out
Really poems are the way I think I can speak
It's hard to see you cry when I am just there to see...
I am working every day to take you onboard
So that you should realize I am not just there to laugh or smile on a seashore
I am no magician to really understand before you speak
But what I know is that this change of yours is something I cannot see
I am consuming your happiness and your charisma
There's a heart inside me shouting I am the sole reason for this change (in phuddu)
But i don't have the guts to accept this life's frame
I want myself to be the reason for your smile
And you should be my tiny little crown
But now what I am, it's true that I am your sadness
And I bring your eyebrows to a big frown
I wish I could tell you and be a little fair
That i am backing you up to whatever you dare
But maybe the last hope is just this page where I write
And I am crying that I can't be a part of your fight
But maybe you've lost the link to this page
So this dream goes away just like
putting my feelings in a cage 

Me
Wishing for it to be untrue
Wishing maybe that msg is not true
But true it is that I've changed maybe
Maybe this change has slipped me from my shoe
This day this hour this time
I don't wanna write
I don't wanna fight
I just wish i could see her for one more time
Maybe not this time, maybe the next life
Maybe i just care too much
Maybe i irritate
Maybe i broke my own tray
Carrying my own fate
Maybe some days off will make me realise
What i was doing wrong
And then maybe I'll rise
With a open eye in the brighter sky
I want to dive (Sky Dive)
I want to ride (F1 car)
I want the Mars (SpaceX)
I want the Car (ModelX Tesla)
I want to run
Maybe she was always the moon
And I was always my own Sun
Maybe I'll try to not care this much anymore
And maybe then things would go
How so ? Nobody can be sure ... 
Maybe i didn't lose her
Maybe she lost me
Maybe for now i should stop
And focus on my own Grand Prix

You were right
Maybe she was always right
And i was only wrong
I was thinking about 
My feelings, way too strong
I took the wrong tilt
Started thinking they were life
But they are not life
They are just a part 
Which should help me fight
And keep us close tight
I wish all I said to her 
could now be removed,
but thats not possible 
if i'll bring a good change 
i know she'll be moved
For now i should stop 
and get a break of five
and then seeing the world i'll be myself more sure
do i need her in my life ?
or do i want her in my life ?
what i did to the first one 
was not acceptable but terrible
and this time i want to be sure
because she is much more than my personal need
she is a soul i believe every broken man like me needs
I hope i could say again to her that i'll try to change
and if i behave the same way, please do not call me 'lame'
She can even take my test and throw me in water
because i really don't want to hurt her 
as she is a soul to me 
just like Hugsy is to Joey
or Teddy is to Bean (Mr. Bean)
my feeling of love is now to be more cleaned ...

She
She is a feeling
She is my cure
She is a medicine
She is so pure
Is she my beat 
Is she my love 
For this now i need to be sure '?'
I was a joker, i have to say
I wanted to be close
And i said things, that were not my say
I'm there for her, and she knows this
But till now i wanted to be close to her in the wrong way
She has her life and wants to fight
She is my beast, and my light
She knows I'm there
When everybody is..
But I'm even there when nobody is
This is a thing she should just know
I'm her pocket genie
I'll take care of her fear and foe
I never said she's pretty
Maybe because her heart is more
That face has got a decent look
But her heart is what i care for more
The better word to use is beautiful
Because this word covers all in full
I don't know why do i talk to her so much in poems
Maybe this reduces anxiety and is my chull
For one last time I wanted to say sorry
That what all I said was not worth it
I wanted to go fast, which I shouldn't
And so now i will be slow, but you need to promise
That you'll think on me and give me some precious time
In your day, in your week ... Because without you, I'm way too weak
I'm way to weak ... 
And understand - it's not bad, if you're someone's strength
Phuddu for you i can go to extreme lengths... 

Time 
I am like a falling leaf
From a tree
and time is still,
I need the wind
which is you
so I can follow you to the very end
And when you're the leaf,
then I am a thief
To never let you touch the soil,
Coz what you are is purer than
when you show yourself as turmoil
Because you are the sea queen
And I am a marine
To drown in you
For I was always yours,
But still, you're not mine

Stay here
You know life is good these days
I want things to stay here now
and then stay here forever
I want us to be here
It's okay when we chat
It's okay when we talk
A call once in a week is good
Some jealousy is always good
Some fighting is good
A little meet once in a while is good
Writing things is good
Inspiring and being inspired is good
I want things to stay here
Right now everything is good
But 'no', says time
I will have to move
You will have to go
But one thing is for sure
These feelings will stay
They are emotions that will stay
It is an energy that will stay
It is a power that will be channeled into something
which will stay
When I'll say 'SURPRISE'
Because life is an adventure
And I have the energy
So you will notice it all
Once you are ready
I want things to stay here
This way they are good
Nobody knows that I talk to you
This much and let us keep it this way
Because I want things to stay here
Right now everything is good
Because it is you who is the 'good'

Black Coffee
It is a fact when I sit in the room corner
Faking some code, or studying or learning
I've learnt to cry with no tears,
because the towel was way too rough to wipe
I've got a permanent wound wiping under my eye
for that's a mark someone is leaving
everyday on me but they don't know
anything about it, as they always see me under a light
well this a wound just on the skin
for i know i've hurt her under the skin
i wish i could have the courage to say
that go for him if you think he's better than me
maybe I am way too emotional for a man to be
The love story of love is even so great,
for there was a man who loved the love's lover so straight
When he bought her a diamond ring she was just okay
But when love bought her a dress, it was way too great
Which is a story that tells the efforts
Of the one you love will always be high
And the one who loves you will never match the sky
So maybe her happiness lies with him
And still I wish I could learn it within
But maybe this heart is not ready to learn
Because she is just the crown I need
If she could only know I just want to see her happy
Even if she is not with me.....
Just Forget me over a black coffee

My story
When the day was calling
and on you the light was falling
you coming to the van
with uncle holding your hand
and I was sitting on the gate
never knowing you'll one day turn my life upside down
but you were able to turn that day
when that song played in my ears
and I still remember the day even if its years
You were my crush that day,
and you stayed for many many days
we turned out to be good friends
so much that some boys from your class were jealous of me
we played and we laughed
I do remember the days when the van was parked
and we talked and talked for minutes and hours
I was stupid at that time
to not realise the importance of a friend
who was my gold mine
time was passing by
it was grade 5, 6 and slowly 9th
I dont remember the reason of our fight
but there was nothing and you knew it
when you said sorry for no reason
and things got better and things were fine
I even remember the day of the farewell,
when I was lurking around with my friends
and didn't even got a photo with you
but at the end you asked me
' we didn't have a photo together '
and then we did
and then we broke apart after the last exam
and we never met again without any reason
we all had our reasons to meet
and so did I until I realised it was all a mistake
and it was too late
I turned to a woman I thought was best for me
but turns out I was wrong the whole time
my heart was secretly beating for someone like milady
and then one day on a call I realised
when my whole world shifted an inch with the speed of light
the day changed me into something I have never wanted to be
and since then I loved you and started to hate myself for what I am
I turned into an emotional mess is the baddest of all
but you pulled out a writer and a poet
and then you pulled out a person who cares
a person who is ready to share
and a person who is making a better person of himself
Everyday when he goes up and down on stairs

Your story
You used to wrap yourself in fairy tales
like a blanket
but it was the cold you loved
sharp shivers as you uncovered the corpses of your beautiful dreams
sweeter goosebumps as Prince Charming
slid one glass slipper over your little toes
a real fit
by the school yard,
real princesses floated by you on fall winds
you saw the gulf between you and the rich girls
and vowed to stop believing in fairy tales
but the stories were in you deep as poison
if Prince Charming was real
if he could've saved you
you needed to be saved from the unfairness of everything
when would he come ?
the answer was a cruel shrug with a hundred fleeting moments
the sneer on danish's face when he flirted with you
or vedansh when he made fun of Ali with you
and the accusation in the eyes when you told someone the thing what happened
from that boy masquerading as a man who tilted you inside your body, your heart
you learned you didn't have the magic what turns a beast into a prince
you've surrounded yourself with the people whom you have always resented
hoping to share their power and you hated yourself
and that diminished you even more
and then right when you thought you might just disappear
then I come in the lines of this poem
I realised myself
and you knew somewhere deep it was too bad to be true
and you let yourself be go down because
you didn't want yourself to be loved
you didn't want yourself to be crowned
but God only knows you deserve the crown

Roam
I will kiss you on the Titanic
As I hold you under the stars
And floating on the sea
We will talk to random strangers 
And throw away all our worries 
As we sail into the river 
Witnessing dolphins and swans 
I will make up for this distance soon
Dissolving you in my arms

Love
We'll go to the Colosseum 
on The Titanic,
and then roam with some Penguins
near the Atlantic....
We'll think sitting in The Stone Henge
and lock 'a lock' on the bridge in Paris,
Then we'll sit in the flame of liberty
and book a day in The Vatican City
We'll climb the Tower of Eiffel
and I'll win you a teddy, in the London Fair by a rifle....
Taj Mahal is the sign of love, I hope you know,
So One day I will  make a castle for you
on a sand beach or in our garden with some snow...

Everyday
starting the day with an ending dream
a never ending cycle 
is that leaves bloom green....
texting you in the morning
to waiting for an eager reply
writing all my stories here
for this is the truth you cannot deny.....
when time shifts to noon
you come online
and i've already had a story written
which you cannot read,
when the day gets over
I text a good night....
and then end my day with a new dream of getting a life
